# Text_extraction_using_OCR
There are 3 types of ocr is there-:
1)Pytesseract
2)easyocr
3)keras-ocr
I have worked on Pytesseract and Keras-OCR. 
Main objective was to extract text from any other object such as clothes, bottle, hoardings etc. 
In Pytesseract I have used tesseract.exe file 
(It can download from-:https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/).
I have used this extension for my project-: https://digi.bib.uni-mannheim.de/tesseract/tesseract-ocr-w64-setup-v5.2.0.20220712.exe .
